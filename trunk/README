So the old version is now super deprecated - I don't think
that it really works so well. I am rewriting for a new
and better version in ./second. I will update this with
instructions on how to use it when it is done!

The program is run by:

./flashcard.py FILE_NAME

where FILENAME is the name of the file containing the flashcard definitions.
Definitions are assumed to be of the format:

WORD - DEFINITION, DEFINITION . . .

as in:


blue - the color of water
green - the color of grass, the color of that chair, my favorite color

where the user is assumed to be correct if they are able to match any of the comma seperated definitions.

Previous results of a user answered definitions are stored in the .history file. If a new user is running the program,
most likely this file should be manually deleted (maybe?). Through its prescence probability distribution transitions are learned
as well as a user's likelihood of answering a word correctly. 

I don't beleive this program to really be ready for distribution yet, as the initial learning phase would probably be rather bumpy
unless a small definitions file was initially used. See the definition of 'working set' on the project home page.
